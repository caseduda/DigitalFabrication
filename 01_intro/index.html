<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Guitar Tuner</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

This device would be used to almost automatically tune a guitar. This device would be attached to the tuning heads of the guitar by the user on a molded clamp. Then, once attached, a microphone would pick up the pitch of the string, and the microcontroller would compare it to the desired pitch. Then, it would use a motor attached to the clamp to adjust the orientation of the tuning head accordingly.

<h4>Idea 2: Guitar Modulation Pedal</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

This device would be used to add either a tremolo, phaser, or both effects to the guitar's output sound. The user would connect their guitar and amp to the 3D-printed case of the device, which would have audio jacks on it. Once powered on, the microcontroller would make a low-frequency oscillation signal based on the userâ€™s control knob settings for rate and depth. This signal would be used to either adjust the volume or shift the effect of the phaser in real time. Additionally, a small LED screen on the pedal would show the current effect being used.

<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 3: WeatherBox</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

This device would be placed on a desk or dresser to inform its user on the current and future weather. The box would be designed using either 3d printing or a mold of something from everyday life such as a water bottle. inside the box, a wi-fi compatible microcontroller would connect to a free weather api, inputting coordinates from a gps module inside the box. Then, with the newly obtained weather information, it would display it on an LED screen. Additionally, the box could also have dials to turn the screen to future weather forecasts.
